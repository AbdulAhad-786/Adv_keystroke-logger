# Adv_keystroke-logger
# Project Description
Keyloggers are a best-of-best example of “silent” cyber threats – they give easy access to your data like username, Password, Date-of-Birth, etc to hackers but it may be nearly impossible
to detect. The history of the use of keyloggers for surveillance purposes dates to the early days of computers. Wikipedia details sundry uses of keyloggers in the 1970s and early 1980s for
various purposes, including government clandestine operations. One of the most famous early incidents took place in the mid-1970s, when Soviet spies developed an amazingly clever
hardware keylogger that targeted IBM Selectric typewriters in the US Embassy and Consulate buildings in Moscow and St Petersburg. Once installed, the keyloggers measured the barely
detectable changes in each typewriter’s regional magnetic field as the print head rotated and moved to type each letter. (Meanwhile, Soviet embassies opted to use manual typewriters
rather than electric ones for typing classified information.) While various forms of keylogging have been occurring for quite some time, the boom in the creation and use of commercial
keyloggers grew to significant numbers in the mid to late 1990s with a all kinds of products quickly coming to market during that time. Since then, the number of commercial keyloggers
available for purchase has exploded to thousands of different products with varying target audiences and in many languages. And although historically keyloggers have targeted the home
user for fraud, industry and modern state-sponsored keylogging is a serious problem, in which a phishing expedition compromises a low-level employee or functionary, and then finds a way to
work itself up in the organization. A keylogger is a tool that is used by the intruder/hackers to monitor all the activities or record the keystrokes that you make on your keyboard device.
Whether they are run or installed on your operating system or embedded with the hardware, few keyloggers are very difficult to detect by Antivirus. Aside from keyloggers being utilized for
revengeful purposes like gathering account information, numbers, names, passwords, and other personal data, they could be used in the office of your company to spy on your employees, at
home to observe your children’s activities and by legislation, imposition to inspect and follow occurrences connected to the implementation of PCs. This project will solely use Python 3.
(version 3.10.7). Multiple modules, such as pynput, smtplib, urllib, multiprocessing, datetime, as well as emailMessage, will be implemented by me... These modules are not standard Python
modules and must be installed. I'm planning to write software to monitor keystrokes on the keyboard and save them to an output file. To expand the project, I will also include a feature
that will periodically (every 60 seconds) check for an internet connection. If one is found, the logs will be transmitted immediately to an email; otherwise, keystrokes will be recorded.
Keylogging software is another name for software that records keystrokes. The keystrokes from the keyboard are tracked using several types of malware. Keystroke logger as a quiet weapon.
So, what exactly is malware? Malware is an often-used but well-understood phrase that refers to malicious programs used by identity thieves, hackers, and internet scammers to control your
computer and execute a variety of tasks. Malware is available in a variety of forms, including Trojan horses, computer viruses, worms, Keyloggers, RATS, and much more. Keylogger, also
known as a Keystroke Spy, is a low-cost monitoring tool that makes it simple and effective to record what users of your computer are doing. For users at home and in the business, this is a
cost-effective but effective tool. Spyware is typically employed to monitor all malicious activity.
Spyware is useful for keeping an eye on ongoing criminal activity. Initially, keylogging software does two actions that connect to the client input: to record keystrokes and check the internet,
or to move the log file to a distant location (for example- email). Keyloggers come in two primary categories:

● Hardware Keylogger

● Software Keylogger


# Setup or Execution Steps

1. first you set the gmail user id or passwd that you created

2. After this,

      "python3 Adv_keystroke-logger.py" 

by upper command the keylogger is executed
